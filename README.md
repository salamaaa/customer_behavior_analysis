Data Analytics Project – README
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from loading and exploring a dataset in Python, cleaning and preparing the data, running SQL queries in PostgreSQL for deeper analysis, and finally creating an interactive Power BI dashboard.
It highlights skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and business intelligence reporting.

📂 Dataset

Source: (Add link or description if applicable)

Format: CSV

Content: Includes information such as (briefly describe key columns—e.g., sales data, customer info, transactions, timestamps, etc.)

Size: (Number of rows/columns)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

PostgreSQL + SQL

Power BI (for data visualization)

Git/GitHub (version control)

🧾 Project Steps
1. Load the Dataset (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Performed initial checks (shape, data types, missing values, summary stats)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis

Correlation analysis

Trend and pattern discovery through visualizations

Identification of outliers and data quality issues

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing/invalid values

Standardized formats (dates, categories, numerical fields)

Removed duplicates

Created new calculated fields if needed

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL

Executed SQL queries to answer analytical questions, e.g.:

Aggregations

Filtering & grouping

Joins and subqueries

Used SQL results to validate Python insights

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset

Designed interactive visuals and KPIs

Built navigable report pages for insights

Added filters, slicers, and drill-down functionality
(Include a screenshot if available)

📈 Results & Insights

Summaries of the most important findings

Key performance trends

Notable patterns discovered in the data

Insights informed by both SQL analysis and Power BI visuals

▶️ How to Run This Project
